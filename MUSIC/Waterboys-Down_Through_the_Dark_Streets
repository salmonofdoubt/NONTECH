Am | F | G | Em | C | A | Dm
Down by old house, over the bridge

Am | F | G | Em | C | A | Dm
Down through the dark streets, where we used to live

Am | F | G | Em | C | A | Dm
Out by the cornfield and the sycamore trees

Am          | F | G | Em | C | A | Dm
Down to the water, will you come, lassie please?


Snow in the town square, December afternoon
Christmas lights, a crescent moon
A boy selling chestnuts, roasted and brown
Dropping black cinders, that hiss on the ground


You and I stand like strangers in our hokusai clothes
Like we come from some strange country that nobody else knows
And to go where the wind blows, are just the words of thieves
So, will you come with me, lassie, will you come lassie, please?


There's a place there by the river, I never showed you before
But !when I'm far away, that's where I go
Outside it's la-amplight, high time we leave
Winter-a-borning, will you come lassie, please?


The big blue sea between us, is thousands of miles
It's cruel I know but you just have to smile
I'd be back for you, if I could just believe
That everything is right and pure


That everything is right and pure
That everything is right and pure
Will you come, lassie, please?
